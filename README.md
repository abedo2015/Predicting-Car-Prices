# Predicting-Car-Prices
Experimenting with KNN

This is a practice in the workflow associated with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. We'll be using this algorithm to predict a car's market price through its attributes.
Each car has various attributes such as:
* Car Weight
* Miles per Gallon
* Car Acceleration Speed
* Motor Displacement
* Etc.

We will be using these features to implement predictive modeling using Univariate and Multivariate models to see which of these features give us the best prediction of the price.
